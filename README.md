# eslint-config-npm

***Note: This is deprecated. npm uses [standard](http://standardjs.com/), and you can perfectly match their style with that. It's also a bit better thought out, although I normally use a modified version of it personally.***

Presets for npm's [coding style](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/coding-style). If I missed anything or made a mistake, please send a PR, and it will probably get accepted. I have Travis CI set up for convenience.
